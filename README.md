# Go introduction via [Documentation](https://golang.org/doc/) 
The documentation does not give recommended use with github and Go tutorials.

## Next up! A Tour Go offline 
This tour is also available as a stand-alone program that you can use without access to the internet. It builds and runs the code samples on your own machine.

To run the tour locally, you'll need to first install Go and then run:

go get golang.org/x/tour
This will place a tour binary in your workspace's bin directory. When you run the tour program, it will open a web browser displaying your local version of the tour.

Of course, you can continue to take the tour through this web site.
